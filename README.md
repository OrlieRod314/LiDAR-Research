# LiDAR-Research
A collection of MATLAB code that I used for my 2019 SARSEF project, "Uncertainty in LiDAR Intensity for Autonomous Navigation". I completed this research at the University of Arizona Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering building in my senior year of high school.

I won a Texas Instruments award with a free Ti-nspire.
Inside I've included the MATLAB scripts that I wrote. I will have to post a link here to the figures and raw data that I took using VeloVue, as well as the research paper, abstract, and presentation. 
I'm really just using this to hold my work online so I don't have to pull it up on my laptop whenever someone wants to see it.

Enjoy!
