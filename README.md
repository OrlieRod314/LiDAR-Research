# LiDAR-Research
A collection of MATLAB code and figures that I used for my 2019 SARSEF project, "Uncertainty in LiDAR Intensity for Autonomous Navigation".
I won a Texas Instruments award with a free Ti-nspire. So yeah, it was pretty sweet.
Inside I've included the raw LiDAR Data, MATLAB scripts, object figures, and maybe some other stuff. 
I'm really just using this to hold my work online so I don't have to pull it up on my laptop whenever someone wants to see it.

Enjoy!
